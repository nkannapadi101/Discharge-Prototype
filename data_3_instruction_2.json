    "Coherence": {
        "score": 5,
        "explanation": "The summary is logically structured and follows a clear narrative from admission through to the patient's condition at discharge.

    },
    "Adherence to Clinical Standards": {
        "score": 4,
        "explanation": "The summary uses appropriate medical terminology and adheres to clinical documentation standards, such as correct use of medical abbreviations and ICD codes. Minor improvements could include providing full names for some drugs or treatments at first mention to ensure clarity for all readers, potentially including non-medical stakeholders."
    },
    "Compassion": {
        "score": 3,
        "explanation": "While the summary is professionally written, it lacks explicit expressions of empathy or a personal touch that can reassure the patient and family about care and recovery.
