It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything.

  "assistant": "[Date]\n\nDear Mr. ___,\n\nI am writing to provide you with a summary of your recent hospital stay from February 10th, 2024, to February 14th, 2024. During this period, you were admitted under the care of Dr. Smith due to symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and fever. Upon admission, a diagnosis of lobar pneumonia with an unspecified organism was established.\n\nUpon presentation, your vital signs included a body temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, a heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 92%. A chest X-ray conducted on the day of your admission revealed consolidation in the left lower lobe, consistent with your pneumonia diagnosis. Laboratory investigations returned with a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 60 mg/L and a white blood cell count (WBC) of 12 x 10^9/L, which indicated an inflammatory response consistent with an infection.\n\nEmpirical antibiotic therapy with intravenous Amoxicillin was initiated on February 10th. As your symptoms improved and your laboratory markers began to normalize\u2014CRP decreased from 60 mg/L to 20 mg/L and WBC from 12 x 10^9/L to 7 x 10^9/L by February 13th\u2014the antibiotic regimen was adjusted from the intravenous form to oral administration.\n\nThroughout your hospital stay, you also received PRN Paracetamol for symptomatic relief and continued with your regular Atorvastatin medication. Your condition responded well to the interventions, as evidenced by a gradual stabilization of body temperature and improvement in oxygen saturation, which reached 98% by February 13th.\n\nDuring daily review rounds, Dr. Smith noted consistent improvement in your clinical condition. Your temperature normalized, and respiratory function stabilized, leading to a transition to oral antibiotics in preparation for discharge.\n\nYou were deemed medically fit for discharge on February 14th, 2024. At the time of discharge, you were advised to continue oral Amoxicillin at home for an additional five days. It is important to maintain adherence to this regimen to ensure complete resolution of the infection. A follow-up appointment in the outpatient clinic has been scheduled for you in two weeks to assess your recovery progress.\n\nThank you for your cooperation and trust in our care during your hospital stay. Should you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please do not hesitate to contact our team.\n\nWishing you continued recovery and good health.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Smith  \n[Hospital/Clinic Name]  \n[Contact Information]"
