Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 70, 'gender': 'Male', 'admission_date': '2024-02-10', 'discharge_date': '2024-02-14'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'diagnosis_code': 'J18.1', 'description': 'Lobar pneumonia, unspecified organism'}], 'drg': {'code': '193', 'description': 'Simple pneumonia and pleurisy with MCC'}, 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'Cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever'}, {'date': '2024-02-14', 'type': 'Discharge'}], 'flowsheets': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'time': '08:00', 'temperature': '38.5\u00b0C', 'heart_rate': '90 bpm', 'blood_pressure': '130/85 mmHg', 'respiratory_rate': '20 breaths/min', 'oxygen_saturation': '92%'}, {'date': '2024-02-11', 'time': '08:00', 'temperature': '37.8\u00b0C', 'heart_rate': '85 bpm', 'blood_pressure': '125/80 mmHg', 'respiratory_rate': '18 breaths/min', 'oxygen_saturation': '94%'}, {'date': '2024-02-12', 'time': '08:00', 'temperature': '37\u00b0C', 'heart_rate': '80 bpm', 'blood_pressure': '120/75 mmHg', 'respiratory_rate': '16 breaths/min', 'oxygen_saturation': '96%'}, {'date': '2024-02-13', 'time': '08:00', 'temperature': '36.5\u00b0C', 'heart_rate': '78 bpm', 'blood_pressure': '118/74 mmHg', 'respiratory_rate': '14 breaths/min', 'oxygen_saturation': '98%'}], 'imaging': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'type': 'Chest X-Ray', 'findings': 'Consolidation in left lower lobe'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'tests': [{'name': 'CRP', 'result': '60 mg/L'}, {'name': 'WBC', 'result': '12 x10^9/L'}, {'name': 'Hemoglobin', 'result': '13.5 g/dL'}, {'name': 'Platelets', 'result': '250 x10^9/L'}]}, {'date': '2024-02-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'CRP', 'result': '50 mg/L'}, {'name': 'WBC', 'result': '11 x10^9/L'}, {'name': 'Hemoglobin', 'result': '13.3 g/dL'}, {'name': 'Platelets', 'result': '245 x10^9/L'}]}, {'date': '2024-02-12', 'tests': [{'name': 'CRP', 'result': '35 mg/L'}, {'name': 'WBC', 'result': '9 x10^9/L'}, {'name': 'Hemoglobin', 'result': '13.1 g/dL'}, {'name': 'Platelets', 'result': '240 x10^9/L'}]}, {'date': '2024-02-13', 'tests': [{'name': 'CRP', 'result': '20 mg/L'}, {'name': 'WBC', 'result': '7 x10^9/L'}, {'name': 'Hemoglobin', 'result': '13 g/dL'}, {'name': 'Platelets', 'result': '238 x10^9/L'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'medication': 'Amoxicillin IV', 'dose': '500 mg', 'frequency': '8 hourly'}, {'date': '2024-02-10', 'medication': 'Paracetamol', 'dose': 'PRN'}, {'date': '2024-02-11', 'medication': 'Amoxicillin IV', 'dose': '250 mg', 'frequency': 'Daily'}, {'date': '2024-02-11', 'medication': 'Atorvastatin PO', 'dose': '20 mg', 'frequency': 'Nightly'}, {'date': '2024-02-12', 'medication': 'Amoxicillin IV', 'dose': '250 mg', 'frequency': 'Daily'}, {'date': '2024-02-12', 'medication': 'Atorvastatin PO', 'dose': '20 mg', 'frequency': 'Nightly'}, {'date': '2024-02-13', 'medication': 'Amoxicillin PO', 'dose': '250 mg', 'frequency': 'Daily'}, {'date': '2024-02-13', 'medication': 'Atorvastatin PO', 'dose': '20 mg', 'frequency': 'Nightly'}], 'notes': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'note_type': 'Admission Note', 'content': 'Patient admitted with symptoms indicative of pneumonia.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nDuring your recent hospitalization from February 10th to February 14th, 2024, you presented with symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and fever, which were suggestive of a respiratory infection. Upon admission, an evaluation, including a chest X-ray, revealed consolidation in the left lower lobe. Subsequently, a diagnosis of lobar pneumonia, unspecified organism (ICD-10 code J18.1), was established. Your condition also corresponded to the DRG code 193 for simple pneumonia and pleurisy with MCC.\n\nOn admission day, your vitals showed a temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Initial laboratory evaluations indicated elevated inflammatory markers, with a CRP of 60 mg/L and WBC count of 12 x10^9/L. Empirical antibiotic therapy with intravenous Amoxicillin at 500 mg every 8 hours accompanied by Paracetamol as needed was promptly initiated.\n\nThroughout your stay, you demonstrated consistent clinical improvement. By February 11th, your temperature had decreased to 37.8\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation improved to 94%. This coincided with a reduction in CRP to 50 mg/L and a WBC count of 11 x10^9/L. Due to marked progress, the Amoxicillin dosage was adjusted to 250 mg daily, and you were started on Atorvastatin 20 mg, to be taken nightly.\n\nOn February 12th, your temperature normalized to 37\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation rose to 96%. The CRP further declined to 35 mg/L, and WBC decreased to 9 x10^9/L. Given these improvements, preparations were made to transition you to oral antibiotics.\n\nBy February 13th, clinical parameters continued to stabilize, with a sustained CRP reduction to 20 mg/L and WBC at 7 x10^9/L. Your vital signs, including a temperature of 36.5\u00b0C and oxygen saturation of 98%, confirmed recovery. Consequently, Amoxicillin was transitioned to oral administration at 250 mg daily, while maintaining Atorvastatin therapy.\n\nUpon discharge on February 14th, you were medically stable and deemed fit to return home. It is advised that you complete a course of oral Amoxicillin for an additional five days. A follow-up appointment in the outpatient clinic has been arranged for two weeks from discharge to monitor your recovery progress and ensure the resolution of the pneumonia.\n\nThank you for your cooperation and patience during your treatment. Should you experience any recurrence of symptoms or have concerns, please do not hesitate to contact your healthcare provider.\n\nSincerely,  \n___"
