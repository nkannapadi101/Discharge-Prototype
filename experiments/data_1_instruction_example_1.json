Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 70, 'gender': 'Male', 'admission_date': '2024-02-10', 'discharge_date': '2024-02-14'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'diagnosis_code': 'J18.1', 'description': 'Lobar pneumonia, unspecified organism'}], 'drg': {'code': '193', 'description': 'Simple pneumonia and pleurisy with MCC'}, 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'Cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever'}, {'date': '2024-02-14', 'type': 'Discharge'}], 'flowsheets': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'time': '08:00', 'temperature': '38.5\u00b0C', 'heart_rate': '90 bpm', 'blood_pressure': '130/85 mmHg', 'respiratory_rate': '20 breaths/min', 'oxygen_saturation': '92%'}, {'date': '2024-02-11', 'time': '08:00', 'temperature': '37.8\u00b0C', 'heart_rate': '85 bpm', 'blood_pressure': '125/80 mmHg', 'respiratory_rate': '18 breaths/min', 'oxygen_saturation': '94%'}, {'date': '2024-02-12', 'time': '08:00', 'temperature': '37\u00b0C', 'heart_rate': '80 bpm', 'blood_pressure': '120/75 mmHg', 'respiratory_rate': '16 breaths/min', 'oxygen_saturation': '96%'}, {'date': '2024-02-13', 'time': '08:00', 'temperature': '36.5\u00b0C', 'heart_rate': '78 bpm', 'blood_pressure': '118/74 mmHg', 'respiratory_rate': '14 breaths/min', 'oxygen_saturation': '98%'}], 'imaging': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'type': 'Chest X-Ray', 'findings': 'Consolidation in left lower lobe'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'tests': [{'name': 'CRP', 'result': '60 mg/L'}, {'name': 'WBC', 'result': '12 x10^9/L'}, {'name': 'Hemoglobin', 'result': '13.5 g/dL'}, {'name': 'Platelets', 'result': '250 x10^9/L'}]}, {'date': '2024-02-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'CRP', 'result': '50 mg/L'}, {'name': 'WBC', 'result': '11 x10^9/L'}, {'name': 'Hemoglobin', 'result': '13.3 g/dL'}, {'name': 'Platelets', 'result': '245 x10^9/L'}]}, {'date': '2024-02-12', 'tests': [{'name': 'CRP', 'result': '35 mg/L'}, {'name': 'WBC', 'result': '9 x10^9/L'}, {'name': 'Hemoglobin', 'result': '13.1 g/dL'}, {'name': 'Platelets', 'result': '240 x10^9/L'}]}, {'date': '2024-02-13', 'tests': [{'name': 'CRP', 'result': '20 mg/L'}, {'name': 'WBC', 'result': '7 x10^9/L'}, {'name': 'Hemoglobin', 'result': '13 g/dL'}, {'name': 'Platelets', 'result': '238 x10^9/L'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'medication': 'Amoxicillin IV', 'dose': '500 mg', 'frequency': '8 hourly'}, {'date': '2024-02-10', 'medication': 'Paracetamol', 'dose': 'PRN'}, {'date': '2024-02-11', 'medication': 'Amoxicillin IV', 'dose': '250 mg', 'frequency': 'Daily'}, {'date': '2024-02-11', 'medication': 'Atorvastatin PO', 'dose': '20 mg', 'frequency': 'Nightly'}, {'date': '2024-02-12', 'medication': 'Amoxicillin IV', 'dose': '250 mg', 'frequency': 'Daily'}, {'date': '2024-02-12', 'medication': 'Atorvastatin PO', 'dose': '20 mg', 'frequency': 'Nightly'}, {'date': '2024-02-13', 'medication': 'Amoxicillin PO', 'dose': '250 mg', 'frequency': 'Daily'}, {'date': '2024-02-13', 'medication': 'Atorvastatin PO', 'dose': '20 mg', 'frequency': 'Nightly'}], 'notes': [{'date': '2024-02-10', 'author': 'Dr. Smith', 'note_type': 'Admission Note', 'content': 'Patient admitted with symptoms indicative of pneumonia.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on February 10, 2024, due to symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and fever. Upon evaluation, a diagnosis of lobar pneumonia, unspecified organism, was established based on clinical presentation and a chest X-ray showing consolidation in the left lower lobe. Your initial vital signs included a temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and an oxygen saturation of 92%.\n\nUpon admission, empirical antibiotic therapy with Amoxicillin IV (500 mg every 8 hours) was initiated, alongside supportive care with Paracetamol as needed for fever. Laboratory tests indicated an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 60 mg/L and a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12 x10^9/L, consistent with infection.\n\nBy February 11, your condition began to show signs of improvement, as evidenced by a reduction in CRP to 50 mg/L and WBC count to 11 x10^9/L. The Amoxicillin dose was adjusted to 250 mg IV daily, and you were commenced on Atorvastatin (20 mg nightly) for cardiovascular protection.\n\nContinued improvement was noted over the following days. By February 12, your temperature had normalized to 37\u00b0C, and your oxygen saturation was 96%. A decision was made to switch to oral antibiotic therapy, starting on February 13, with Amoxicillin 250 mg daily. Your inflammatory markers continued their downward trend, with CRP decreasing to 35 mg/L on February 12 and further to 20 mg/L by February 13.\n\nOn February 13, you continued to demonstrate clinical improvement, with reduced respiratory symptoms and stable vital signs, leading to planning for discharge.\n\nUpon discharge on February 14, 2024, your condition is significantly improved, and you are medically fit for home management. A transition to oral Amoxicillin 250 mg daily for an additional five days is advised. You are scheduled for follow-up in the outpatient clinic in two weeks to reassess your recovery and make any further management decisions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor your symptoms and seek medical advice if there is any recurrence or worsening of symptoms. It is crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics and maintain any additional medication regimens as prescribed.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. ___"
