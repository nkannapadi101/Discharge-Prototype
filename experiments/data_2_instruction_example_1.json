  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 1, 2024, presenting with severe chest pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath. Upon evaluation, an Electrocardiogram (ECG) confirmed the presence of an ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). A diagnosis of an acute transmural myocardial infarction of the anterior wall was established.\n\nOn the same day of admission, you underwent a Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) with stent placement, which stabilized your condition. Your vital signs remained stable post-procedure, and you reported no recurrent chest pain. Continuous monitoring was maintained throughout your stay.\n\nOn March 2, 2024, during the ward round, it was noted that you felt better, with effective pain management, and a decrease in troponin levels was observed. Medications were initiated including Aspirin (325 mg once daily), Clopidogrel (75 mg once daily), an IV Heparin infusion, Nitroglycerin for PRN chest pain, Metoprolol (50 mg twice daily), Lisinopril (10 mg once daily), and a Statin (40 mg daily).\n\nYou showed significant improvement and, by March 3, 2024, discharge preparations, including discussions on rehabilitation, were in progress. Your condition remained stable, and you expressed understanding of your medication regimen.\n\nBy March 4, 2024, pre-discharge checks confirmed your readiness for discharge, with all medications reviewed, and discharge instructions provided. You were formally discharged on March 6, 2024, having remained clinically stable without complications throughout your hospital stay.\n\nYou are scheduled to attend a follow-up appointment at the cardiology outpatient clinic on March 20, 2024, to assess your recovery and medication management. It is important that you adhere to the prescribed medication regimen and lifestyle modifications discussed with you. These include adopting a heart-healthy diet low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium, with increased intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Gradual reintroduction of physical activity, starting with light walking, aims to build up to at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Immediate smoking cessation is critical, and options for nicotine replacement therapy and counseling are available to support quitting. Managing stress through mindfulness, yoga, or meditation, with professional support if needed, is also encouraged.\n\nThank you for your cooperation and understanding during your hospital stay. Please contact your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns prior to your follow-up appointment.\n\nSincerely,\n\n___"
