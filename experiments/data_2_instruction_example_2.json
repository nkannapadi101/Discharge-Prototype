  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 58, 'gender': 'Male', 'admission_date': '2024-03-01', 'discharge_date': '2024-03-06'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-01', 'diagnosis_code': 'I21.0', 'description': 'Acute transmural myocardial infarction of anterior wall'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-01', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'Severe chest pain, radiating to left arm, shortness of breath'}, {'date': '2024-03-01', 'type': 'ECG', 'findings': 'ST-elevation MI (STEMI)'}, {'date': '2024-03-01', 'type': 'PCI', 'description': 'Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with stent placement'}, {'date': '2024-03-02', 'type': 'Ward Round', 'notes': 'Patient stable, no recurrent chest pain, monitoring continues'}, {'date': '2024-03-03', 'type': 'Ward Round', 'notes': 'Vitals stable, patient reports feeling better, troponin levels decreasing'}, {'date': '2024-03-04', 'type': 'Ward Round', 'notes': 'Significant improvement, discussing discharge plans and rehabilitation'}, {'date': '2024-03-05', 'type': 'Ward Round', 'notes': 'Discharge instructions given, medications prescribed, follow-up scheduled'}, {'date': '2024-03-06', 'type': 'Discharge'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-01', 'tests': [{'name': 'Troponin', 'result': 'Elevated, peaking at 12h post admission'}, {'name': 'CBC', 'result': 'Within normal limits'}, {'name': 'Lipid Profile', 'result': 'Elevated LDL cholesterol'}]}, {'date': '2024-03-02', 'tests': [{'name': 'Troponin', 'result': 'Beginning to decrease'}]}, {'date': '2024-03-03', 'tests': [{'name': 'Troponin', 'result': 'Continues to decrease'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-01', 'medication': 'Aspirin', 'dose': '325 mg', 'frequency': 'Once daily'}, {'date': '2024-03-01', 'medication': 'Clopidogrel', 'dose': '75 mg', 'frequency': 'Once daily'}, {'date': '2024-03-01', 'medication': 'IV Heparin', 'dose': 'Adjust per protocol', 'frequency': 'Continuous infusion'}, {'date': '2024-03-01', 'medication': 'Nitroglycerin', 'dose': '0.4 mg', 'frequency': 'Every 5 minutes PRN for chest pain'}, {'date': '2024-03-02', 'medication': 'Beta-Blocker', 'dose': 'Metoprolol 50 mg', 'frequency': 'Twice daily'}, {'date': '2024-03-02', 'medication': 'ACE Inhibitor', 'dose': 'Lisinopril 10 mg', 'frequency': 'Once daily'}, {'date': '2024-03-02', 'medication': 'Statin', 'dose': '40 mg', 'frequency': 'Once daily'}], 'follow_up_care': [{'type': 'Cardiology outpatient clinic', 'details': 'Follow-up appointment scheduled for 2024-03-20 to assess recovery and medication management.'}], 'lifestyle_modifications': [{'recommendation': 'Diet', 'details': 'Adopt a heart-healthy diet low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 1, 2024, due to severe chest pain which radiated to your left arm, accompanied by shortness of breath. Following an initial evaluation, an electrocardiogram (ECG) confirmed the presence of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), specifically diagnosing an acute transmural myocardial infarction of the anterior wall.\n\nImmediately upon your admission, a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, which involved the placement of a stent to restore coronary blood flow. Post-procedure, your condition stabilized without recurrent chest pain, as noted during continuous monitoring.\n\nDuring your hospital stay, your vital signs remained stable, and you reported progressive improvement in your symptoms. The laboratory tests conducted upon admission revealed elevated troponin levels, which peaked at 12 hours post-admission but subsequently began decreasing. A complete blood count (CBC) was within normal limits, while your lipid profile showed elevated LDL cholesterol, which will be managed with appropriate medication and lifestyle adjustments.\n\nYour medication regimen initiated on admission included Aspirin at a dose of 325 mg once daily, Clopidogrel 75 mg once daily, and a continuous infusion of IV Heparin, adjusted per protocol. Nitroglycerin was prescribed at 0.4 mg every 5 minutes as needed for chest pain. On March 2, 2024, we commenced additional medications including Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, at 50 mg twice daily, Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, at 10 mg once daily, and a statin at 40 mg once daily to manage cholesterol levels.\n\nAs part of the discharge plan, you were provided with comprehensive instructions regarding your medication regimen and were educated on the importance of adherence to the prescribed treatments. A follow-up appointment has been scheduled at the cardiology outpatient clinic on March 20, 2024, to assess your recovery progress and to make any necessary adjustments to your medication.\n\nIn addition to medical treatment, it is crucial that you adopt lifestyle modifications to support your recovery. These include adhering to a heart-healthy diet low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium, and gradually reintroducing physical activity beginning with light walking. Aim to build up to a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Immediate cessation of smoking is strongly advised, and options such as nicotine replacement therapy and counseling are available to assist you. Managing stress through techniques such as mindfulness, yoga, or meditation is encouraged, with professional support available if needed.\n\nAt the time of discharge on March 6, 2024, your condition has significantly improved, with no recurrence of chest pain, and your overall readiness for discharge has been confirmed. Please continue with the outlined follow-up care and lifestyle recommendations to aid in your ongoing recovery.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. ___"
