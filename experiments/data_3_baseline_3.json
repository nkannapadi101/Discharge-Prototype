  "assistant": "[Hospital Name]  \n[Hospital Address]  \n[City, State, ZIP Code]\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\nDear ___,\n\nWe are writing to provide you with the discharge summary following your recent hospital stay. You were admitted to our facility on March 10, 2024, after experiencing a fall that resulted in a loss of consciousness. Initial assessments and a CT scan conducted on March 11 confirmed that you had suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage, specifically a hemorrhagic stroke, in the right hemisphere of your brain.\n\nThroughout your hospitalization, several diagnostic tests were performed. Your complete blood count (CBC) revealed that your hemoglobin was slightly low and your white blood cell count was elevated. A coagulation profile indicated an elevated INR, suggesting prolonged bleeding time.\n\nIn response to these findings, you were administered Mannitol every six hours to manage cerebral edema and antihypertensives as per your blood pressure requirements. Despite ongoing treatment, including close monitoring and protection measures to prevent further falls, your neurological status showed no significant improvement, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 11 and persistent slurred speech and right-sided weakness.\n\nDiscussions with your family were conducted to update them on your prognosis and the continued care that you will require after returning home. It is crucial to follow up with your primary care physician or a neurologist as soon as possible for ongoing management of your condition. Please ensure that you adhere to any prescribed medication regimen and attend all recommended follow-up appointments.\n\nWe understand that this has been a challenging time for you and your family, and the medical team is here to support you during your recovery journey. Should you have any questions regarding your discharge plan or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.\n\nWe wish you a safe and steady recovery.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. ___  \n[Title/Position]  \n[Contact Information]"
