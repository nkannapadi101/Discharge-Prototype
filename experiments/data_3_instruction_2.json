  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology.

  "assistant": "[Hospital Letterhead]\n\nDate: March 20, 2024\n\nTo: ___ [Patient's Name]\nAddress: ___\n\nDear ___,\n\nSubject: Discharge Summary\n\nWe hope this letter finds you well. This correspondence contains a summary of your recent hospital stay and outlines the follow-up care required once you leave our facility.\n\nYou, a 65-year-old female, were admitted to our hospital on March 10, 2024, following a fall and subsequent loss of consciousness. Upon initial examination, you presented with a decreased level of consciousness and slurred speech. Your Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was assessed as 11 upon admission.\n\nOn March 11, 2024, a computed tomography (CT) scan was conducted, which revealed a hemorrhagic stroke located in the right hemisphere. You were diagnosed with an unspecified intracerebral hemorrhage (Diagnosis code: I61.9). Concurrent laboratory evaluations showed a slight decrease in hemoglobin levels and elevated white blood cell count. Additionally, your coagulation profile indicated prolonged bleeding time, with INR results suggesting the same.\n\nTherapeutic interventions included the administration of Mannitol at a dosage of 0.25 g/kg every six hours, intended to address cerebral edema. Antihypertensive medications were also initiated with dosages adjusted based on blood pressure readings.\n\nThroughout the subsequent days, your condition continued to require significant monitoring. On March 11, there was limited improvement noted in your neurological status, characterized by ongoing right-sided weakness and persistent slurred speech. Safety precautions were implemented to prevent further falls due to observed agitation and confusion.\n\nOn March 12, a discussion with your family occurred to address your prognosis and ongoing care needs. Your condition was described as critical at this time, necessitating continued hospitalization beyond the initially expected discharge date for your safety and recovery.\n\nAt discharge, you may continue to experience some neurological deficits. It is essential to attend follow-up appointments with a neurologist for further evaluation and to manage any persistent or emergent symptoms effectively. You are advised to continue the prescribed medications and adhere to a rehabilitation program tailored to your recovery needs.\n\nShould you experience any unusual symptoms or require assistance, please contact your healthcare provider promptly.\n\nWe appreciate your trust in our care, and we are committed to supporting your recovery.\n\nWishing you health and well-being,\n\nSincerely,\n\n___ [Physician's Name]\n___ [Hospital/Clinic Name]\n___ [Contact Information]"
