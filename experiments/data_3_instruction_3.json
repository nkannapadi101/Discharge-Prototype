  "assistant": "The Medical Team  \n___ Hospital  \n___  \n___  \n\nMarch 20, 2024  \n\nDear Dr. ___,\n\nRe: Discharge Summary for ___ (65-year-old female)  \n\nWe are writing to provide a summary regarding the recent hospitalization of your patient, ___, who was admitted on March 10, 2024, due to a fall that resulted in a subsequent loss of consciousness. \n\nUpon admission, the patient exhibited a decreased level of consciousness with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11. Slurring of speech was also noted. A CT scan conducted on March 11, 2024, confirmed the presence of an unspecified intracerebral hemorrhage (Diagnosis Code: I61.9) in the right hemisphere, consistent with a hemorrhagic stroke. \n\nLaboratory investigations revealed a slightly low hemoglobin level and an elevated white blood cell count. The coagulation profile indicated an elevated INR, suggestive of prolonged bleeding time. In light of these findings, the patient was initiated on a regimen of Mannitol at a dosage of 0.25 g/kg every six hours to manage cerebral edema. Additionally, antihypertensive medications were administered with dosing adjusted according to blood pressure readings. \n\nDespite the interventions, ward rounds documented a lack of significant improvement in neurological status. The patient continued to experience right-sided weakness and slurred speech, maintaining a GCS score of 11. Episodes of agitation and confusion were observed. Safety measures were employed to mitigate the risk of further falls. Discussions with the family regarding prognosis and the need for ongoing critical care formed part of our management approach.\n\nAs of the expected discharge date of March 20, 2024, the patient remains under close observation, given her current critical status. Continued rehabilitation focusing on improving neurological function, as well as monitoring and adjusting medical management for hypertension and coagulopathy, remain imperative.\n\nFor follow-up, we recommend regular assessments by a neurologist to evaluate progress and modify treatment plans as required. Home healthcare support may be beneficial for ongoing rehabilitation efforts. \n\nWe trust this discharge summary provides a comprehensive review of the patient's hospital course. Please feel free to contact us for further discussions regarding ___'s care plan and future needs.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. ___  \nAttending Physician  \n___ Hospital"
