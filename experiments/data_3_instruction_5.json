  "assistant": "[Hospital Name]  \n[Hospital Address]  \n[City, State, ZIP Code]  \n[Date]\n\nDear ___,\n\nThis letter summarizes your recent hospital stay and outlines the plans for your continued care following your discharge. You were admitted to our facility on March 10, 2024, following a fall and subsequent loss of consciousness. Upon admission, your Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was recorded at 11, and slurring of speech was noted.\n\nOn March 11, 2024, a CT scan was performed which confirmed the presence of a hemorrhagic stroke in the right hemisphere of your brain. This identification led to a diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified, coded as I61.9. To manage cerebral edema, mannitol was administered at a dose of 0.25 g/kg every six hours. Furthermore, antihypertensive medications were given as per blood pressure requirements.\n\nLaboratory assessments conducted on March 11 showed a slightly low hemoglobin count and elevated white blood cells. The coagulation profile indicated an elevated INR which suggested a prolonged bleeding time.\n\nThroughout your stay, evaluations on March 11, 2024, indicated right-sided weakness alongside persistent slurred speech. Despite these interventions, as of March 12, your condition remained critical with ongoing symptoms and no significant change in your neurological status. Due to the presence of agitation and confusion, safety measures were implemented to prevent further falls.\n\nDuring a discussion involving your family, considerations regarding your prognosis and ongoing care needs were addressed. At that time, your medical team deemed that you required continued monitoring and were not yet safe for discharge.\n\nPlease ensure that you adhere to your follow-up care appointments post-discharge. It is important to continue the prescribed medical regimen and consult with your healthcare provider for any concerns or if new symptoms arise.\n\nWe kindly ask that you schedule a follow-up consultation with your primary care physician or neurologist soon after discharge to reassess your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\n\nWe are here to assist you throughout your recovery. Should you have any questions regarding your care or need additional information, do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nWishing you a safe and speedy recovery.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDr. ___  \n[Title/Position]  \n[Contact Information]"
