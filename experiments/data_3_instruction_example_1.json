They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 10, 2024, following a fall and subsequent loss of consciousness. Your initial presentation included a decreased level of consciousness with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11, slurred speech, and the onset of neurological symptoms, warranting further investigation.\n\nOn March 11, 2024, a CT scan was conducted, revealing a hemorrhagic stroke resulting in an intracerebral hemorrhage in the right hemisphere. Concurrent laboratory tests displayed slight anemia with elevated white blood cell counts and an elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR), indicating prolonged bleeding time. \n\nIn response to the findings, treatment commenced with the administration of Mannitol at a dosage of 0.25 g/kg every six hours to reduce cerebral edema. Additionally, antihypertensive medications were instituted to manage blood pressure, with doses adjusted according to your blood pressure readings.\n\nThroughout your stay, you exhibited persistent right-sided weakness and slurred speech. Frequent evaluations were conducted, revealing no significant neurological improvements, with your GCS score remaining at 11. You also experienced episodes of agitation and confusion, necessitating close monitoring and the implementation of safety measures to prevent additional falls.\n\nDiscussions with your family regarding your prognosis and ongoing care needs took place, emphasizing the critical nature of your condition and the requirement for continued medical supervision. You remained hemodynamically stable without further decline in your neurological assessment until your eventual discharge on March 20, 2024.\n\nAt discharge, you still exhibit right-sided weakness and slurred speech. It is imperative to follow the outlined care plan upon returning home. You will need frequent follow-ups with your healthcare providers to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as necessary. Continued management of hypertension and attention to potential coagulation issues are recommended.\n\nFurther neurological evaluations and rehabilitative therapy will likely be beneficial in optimizing your recovery. Please ensure that you attend all scheduled outpatient appointments for ongoing assessment and management. \n\nShould any concerns arise following your discharge, promptly contacting your primary care physician or seeking medical evaluation will be essential. An appointment with your general practitioner is advisable within the subsequent weeks to coordinate care and address any emerging needs or adjustments to your treatment regimen.\n\nWe wish you the best for your recovery.\n\nSincerely,\n____"
