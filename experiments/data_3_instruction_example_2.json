  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 65, 'gender': 'Female', 'admission_date': '2024-03-10', 'expected_discharge_date': '2024-03-20'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'diagnosis_code': 'I61.9', 'description': 'Intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'Fall and subsequent loss of consciousness'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'type': 'CT Scan', 'findings': 'Hemorrhagic stroke identified in the right hemisphere'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'CBC', 'result': 'Hemoglobin slightly low, WBC elevated'}, {'name': 'Coagulation profile', 'result': 'INR elevated, suggesting prolonged bleeding time'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Mannitol', 'dose': '0.25 g/kg', 'frequency': 'Every 6 hours'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Antihypertensives', 'dose': 'Varies', 'frequency': 'As per BP'}], 'ward_round_notes': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'time': 'Evening', 'note': 'Patient experienced a fall last night, now with decreased level of consciousness.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 10, 2024, following a fall and subsequent loss of consciousness. Upon admission, it was noted that your level of consciousness had decreased, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score recorded at 11. Additionally, you exhibited slurred speech.\n\nOn March 11, 2024, a CT scan of your brain revealed a hemorrhagic stroke located in the right hemisphere. Consequently, a diagnosis of unspecified intracerebral hemorrhage (I61.9) was established. To manage cerebral edema, you were started on Mannitol at a dosage of 0.25 g/kg every six hours. Furthermore, antihypertensive medication was administered with dosages adjusted according to your blood pressure levels.\n\nYour initial laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count (CBC), indicated that hemoglobin levels were slightly low, and white blood cell counts were elevated. The coagulation profile revealed an elevated INR, suggestive of a prolonged bleeding time.\n\nThroughout your hospitalization, regular neurological examinations confirmed right-sided weakness and persistent slurred speech. Despite continued treatment, there was no significant improvement in your neurological status, and your GCS remained at 11. Agitation and confusion were noted during the evening assessment on March 11, 2024. Given these findings, you were not deemed safe for discharge at that juncture, necessitating continued monitoring and safety measures to prevent further falls.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, your condition remained critical with ongoing slurred speech and right-sided weakness. Discussions were held with your family regarding your prognosis and ongoing care needs.\n\nAt the time of discharge, your condition should be reassessed to ensure stability and safety for returning home or transferred to a rehabilitation facility as determined appropriate.\n\nYour follow-up care plan will be important in monitoring your recovery and addressing any ongoing healthcare needs. Please make arrangements for continued medical care and attend follow-up appointments as recommended by your healthcare provider.\n\nWishing you a progressive recovery and improved health.\n\nSincerely,\n\n___"
