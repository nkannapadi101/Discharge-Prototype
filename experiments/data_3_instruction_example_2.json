  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 10, 2024, following a fall and subsequent loss of consciousness. Upon admission, you experienced a decreased level of consciousness, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11, and slurred speech was noted. An initial CT scan conducted on March 11, 2024, confirmed the presence of a hemorrhagic stroke in the right hemisphere, leading to your diagnosis of unspecified intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\nYour complete blood count revealed a slightly low hemoglobin level, and your white blood cell count was elevated. The coagulation profile showed an elevated INR, suggesting prolonged bleeding time, which was monitored closely during your stay.\n\nTo manage cerebral edema, treatment with Mannitol at a dose of 0.25 g/kg every six hours was initiated on March 11, 2024. Additionally, antihypertensive medications were administered as per your blood pressure requirements to control any fluctuations that could exacerbate your condition.\n\nDuring ward rounds on the evening of March 11, it was noted that there was no significant improvement in your neurological status. The GCS remained at 11, and you exhibited signs of agitation and confusion. Consequently, safety measures were implemented to prevent further falls. On the morning of March 12, 2024, your condition remained critical, with persistent slurred speech and right-sided weakness. Discussions were held with your family about your prognosis and ongoing care needs, and it was determined that you were not yet safe for discharge.\n\nAt the time of discharge, your clinical status showed improvement, although some symptoms such as slurred speech and right-sided weakness persisted. Continued care and monitoring are required to manage these residual symptoms and to facilitate your recovery.\n\nFor follow-up, it is recommended that you engage with specialized rehabilitation services for continued management of your condition. Please ensure that follow-up appointments with your primary care physician and neurologist are scheduled shortly after discharge to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as necessary. We emphasize the importance of adhering to the medication regimen prescribed to you upon discharge and attending all scheduled appointments to support your recovery trajectory.\n\nWe wish you a continued recovery and improvement in your health.\n\nSincerely,  \n___"
