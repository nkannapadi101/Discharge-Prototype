  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 65, 'gender': 'Female', 'admission_date': '2024-03-10', 'expected_discharge_date': '2024-03-20'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'diagnosis_code': 'I61.9', 'description': 'Intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'Fall and subsequent loss of consciousness'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'type': 'CT Scan', 'findings': 'Hemorrhagic stroke identified in the right hemisphere'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'CBC', 'result': 'Hemoglobin slightly low, WBC elevated'}, {'name': 'Coagulation profile', 'result': 'INR elevated, suggesting prolonged bleeding time'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Mannitol', 'dose': '0.25 g/kg', 'frequency': 'Every 6 hours'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Antihypertensives', 'dose': 'Varies', 'frequency': 'As per BP'}], 'ward_round_notes': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'time': 'Evening', 'note': 'Patient experienced a fall last night, now with decreased level of consciousness.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 10, 2024, following a fall and a subsequent loss of consciousness. Upon admission, you exhibited a decreased level of consciousness, and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11 was recorded, alongside slurring of speech.\n\nThe following day, March 11, 2024, a CT scan was conducted, which confirmed a diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke (diagnosis code I61.9) affecting the right hemisphere, as indicated by an intracerebral hemorrhage. This diagnosis was followed by a comprehensive evaluation of your neurological function, which revealed persistent right-sided weakness and continued slurred speech. In light of these findings, it was determined that close monitoring was necessary, and you were not deemed safe for discharge.\n\nYour laboratory results from the same day included a complete blood count (CBC), which showed slightly low hemoglobin levels and an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. A coagulation profile indicated an elevated INR, suggesting prolonged bleeding time. In response to the cerebral edema detected, a mannitol regimen was initiated on March 11, administered at a dose of 0.25 g/kg every 6 hours. Additionally, antihypertensive medications were prescribed based on your blood pressure readings.\n\nOn the evening of March 11, despite treatment measures, your neurological status showed no significant improvement, with GCS remaining at 11. You showed signs of agitation and confusion, and appropriate safety measures were implemented to minimize the risk of further falls.\n\nBy the morning of March 12, your condition remained critical, with ongoing right-sided weakness and persistent slurred speech. Discussions were held with your family regarding your prognosis and the need for continued care. At that time, you were not safe for discharge.\n\nYou are expected to be discharged from the hospital on March 20, 2024, and it is crucial to continue with the prescribed management plan and follow-up care. Please ensure to attend all subsequent appointments and adhere to the treatment regime as advised by your healthcare team.\n\nWe trust that your ongoing care will be managed effectively, and recommend close observation by your healthcare providers. Should you or your family have any questions or require further information, please feel free to contact us.\n\nSincerely,  \n___"
