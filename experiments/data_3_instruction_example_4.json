  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 65, 'gender': 'Female', 'admission_date': '2024-03-10', 'expected_discharge_date': '2024-03-20'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'diagnosis_code': 'I61.9', 'description': 'Intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'Fall and subsequent loss of consciousness'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'type': 'CT Scan', 'findings': 'Hemorrhagic stroke identified in the right hemisphere'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'CBC', 'result': 'Hemoglobin slightly low, WBC elevated'}, {'name': 'Coagulation profile', 'result': 'INR elevated, suggesting prolonged bleeding time'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Mannitol', 'dose': '0.25 g/kg', 'frequency': 'Every 6 hours'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Antihypertensives', 'dose': 'Varies', 'frequency': 'As per BP'}], 'ward_round_notes': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'time': 'Evening', 'note': 'Patient experienced a fall last night, now with decreased level of consciousness.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 10, 2024, following a fall that resulted in a loss of consciousness. Upon your admission, you experienced a decreased level of consciousness, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11, and displayed slurred speech.\n\nA CT scan conducted on March 11, 2024, confirmed the presence of a hemorrhagic stroke, specifically an intracerebral hemorrhage located in the right hemisphere. In response to these findings, treatment with Mannitol was initiated to address cerebral edema. You were administered a dose of 0.25 g/kg every 6 hours. Additionally, antihypertensive medications were provided, with dosages adjusted according to your blood pressure readings.\n\nLaboratory tests on March 11, 2024, revealed a slight decrease in hemoglobin levels, an elevated white blood cell count, and an elevated INR, suggestive of prolonged bleeding time. These findings necessitated careful monitoring of your coagulation profile and blood counts.\n\nThroughout your stay, you continued to exhibit right-sided weakness and persistent slurred speech. On the morning of March 12, 2024, it was noted that there had been no significant improvement in your neurological status, with your GCS remaining at 11. You displayed signs of agitation and confusion, and safety measures were implemented to prevent further falls.\n\nDespite ongoing treatment and care, your condition remained critical, with persistent neurological deficits. Discussion with your family regarding your prognosis and ongoing care needs took place, emphasizing that discharge was not safe at that time. \n\nThe medical team continues to recommend close monitoring and assessments while in the hospital. We will work together with you and your family on planning for your care needs post-discharge when it becomes appropriate. \n\nIt is important to continue regular follow-up with your healthcare providers to monitor your recovery progress.\n\nKind regards,\n\nDr. ___"
