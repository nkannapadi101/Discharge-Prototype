  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything.

Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 65, 'gender': 'Female', 'admission_date': '2024-03-10', 'expected_discharge_date': '2024-03-20'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'diagnosis_code': 'I61.9', 'description': 'Intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'Fall and subsequent loss of consciousness'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'type': 'CT Scan', 'findings': 'Hemorrhagic stroke identified in the right hemisphere'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'CBC', 'result': 'Hemoglobin slightly low, WBC elevated'}, {'name': 'Coagulation profile', 'result': 'INR elevated, suggesting prolonged bleeding time'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Mannitol', 'dose': '0.25 g/kg', 'frequency': 'Every 6 hours'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Antihypertensives', 'dose': 'Varies', 'frequency': 'As per BP'}], 'ward_round_notes': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'time': 'Evening', 'note': 'Patient experienced a fall last night, now with decreased level of consciousness.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 10, 2024, following a fall and subsequent loss of consciousness. At the time of admission, you presented with a decreased level of consciousness and your Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was recorded at 11. Slurred speech was noted during the initial examination.\n\nOn March 11, 2024, a CT scan was conducted which confirmed the presence of a hemorrhagic stroke located in the right hemisphere. You were diagnosed with an unspecified intracerebral hemorrhage, which is consistent with the clinical findings. Following this diagnosis, you were started on Mannitol at a dose of 0.25 g/kg every 6 hours to manage the associated cerebral edema. Additionally, antihypertensive medications were administered, with the dosage adjusted according to your blood pressure readings.\n\nLaboratory investigations on March 11, 2024, included a complete blood count (CBC) which showed a slightly low hemoglobin level and elevated white blood cell count. The coagulation profile indicated an elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR), suggestive of a prolonged bleeding time which required careful monitoring.\n\nDuring your hospital stay, the neurological examinations highlighted persistent right-sided weakness, continued slurred speech, and a GCS score which remained at 11. You exhibited signs of agitation and confusion, necessitating safety measures to prevent further falls. Given the critical nature of your condition and the ongoing symptoms, a discussion was held with your family concerning your prognosis and the need for ongoing care and close monitoring.\n\nAs of the last note entered on March 12, 2024, your condition remained critical with persistent slurred speech and right-sided weakness. Plans for discharge are contingent upon further stabilization and improvement, which will be reassessed on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe recommend that you attend regular follow-up appointments, and these will be arranged in accordance with your recovery progress. You will be contacted with details concerning your follow-up care plan, and it is important to adhere to this schedule to ensure optimal management of your condition.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions or concerns about your ongoing treatment.\n\nSincerely, \n\n___"
