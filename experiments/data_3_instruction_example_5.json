  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 65, 'gender': 'Female', 'admission_date': '2024-03-10', 'expected_discharge_date': '2024-03-20'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'diagnosis_code': 'I61.9', 'description': 'Intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'Fall and subsequent loss of consciousness'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'type': 'CT Scan', 'findings': 'Hemorrhagic stroke identified in the right hemisphere'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'CBC', 'result': 'Hemoglobin slightly low, WBC elevated'}, {'name': 'Coagulation profile', 'result': 'INR elevated, suggesting prolonged bleeding time'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Mannitol', 'dose': '0.25 g/kg', 'frequency': 'Every 6 hours'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Antihypertensives', 'dose': 'Varies', 'frequency': 'As per BP'}], 'ward_round_notes': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'time': 'Evening', 'note': 'Patient experienced a fall last night, now with decreased level of consciousness.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 10, 2024, following a fall that resulted in a subsequent loss of consciousness. On initial assessment, you exhibited a decreased level of consciousness with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11. Slurring of speech was noted during the evaluation on the evening of your admission.\n\nOn March 11, 2024, a CT scan was performed, which identified a hemorrhagic stroke located in the right hemisphere of your brain. This finding confirmed the diagnosis of an intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified, as documented in your records.\n\nConsidering the CT scan results, treatment with Mannitol was initiated at a dose of 0.25 g/kg every 6 hours to manage cerebral edema. Additionally, antihypertensive medication was administered as needed, based on your blood pressure readings, to mitigate further risks.\n\nYour laboratory tests revealed a slightly low hemoglobin level and elevated white blood cell count on the complete blood count (CBC) performed on the same day. The coagulation profile indicated an elevated INR, suggesting a prolonged bleeding time, which required careful monitoring.\n\nThroughout your stay, your neurological status was closely observed. Despite the interventions, there was no significant improvement, as noted in repeated evaluations. You continued to show signs of agitation and confusion, with persistent right-sided weakness and slurred speech, while the GCS remained unchanged at 11.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, it was discussed with your family regarding the critical nature of your condition and the prognosis, as well as the required ongoing care. It was determined that you were not safe for discharge at that point due to the potential risks and need for further monitoring.\n\nYour continued care requires close neurological monitoring and management of your cerebral edema and blood pressure. Discussions shall continue with your family to ensure your care needs are met during this challenging time.\n\nWishing you a safe recovery.\n\nSincerely,\n____"
