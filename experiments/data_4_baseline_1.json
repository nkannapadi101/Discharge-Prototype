  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nWe hope this letter finds you in better health and spirits. We are writing to summarize the details of your recent hospital stay and the treatment you received while under our care.\n\nYou were admitted to our hospital on March 10, 2024, due to complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon initial assessment, your ECG revealed ST elevation in the v5-6 leads, leading to a diagnosis of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the left main coronary artery as confirmed on March 11, 2024.\n\nDuring your stay, several interventions were initiated following local hospital guidelines. Unfortunately, we were unable to contact the catheterization lab and the cardiology team despite persistent attempts, but we ensured that you received the necessary medical support. Care protocol included the administration of Morphine to control pain, Oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygen saturation, Nitroglycerin for chest pain relief, and a single dose of chewed Aspirin. Your lab tests indicated elevated Troponin T levels, consistent with myocardial infarction.\n\nOn the night of March 12, 2024, you reported that your chest pain had resolved and expressed the desire to be discharged. We agreed that it was appropriate for you to return home with specific instructions for your continued care and follow-up.\n\nPlease be sure to monitor your health closely and adhere to any recommendations provided by the medical team during your discharge instructions. Should you experience any recurrence of symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately.\n\nThank you for allowing us to care for you during your time at our facility. We wish you a smooth and speedy recovery and encourage you to keep in touch with your healthcare provider for ongoing care.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nDr. ___  \n[Your Hospital's Name]  \n[Contact Information]"
