It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully.

  "assistant": "[Date]\n\nDear Mr. ___,\n\nWe hope this letter finds you in good health. We are writing to provide a summary of your recent hospital stay and your current condition, as well as to outline recommendations for your follow-up care.\n\nYour admission to the hospital occurred on March 10, 2024, following an acute presentation of chest pain and shortness of breath. Initial assessments, including an Electrocardiogram (ECG), revealed ST elevation in leads V5-6, indicative of an acute myocardial infarction. This clinical presentation led to your admission under the diagnosis of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the left main coronary artery (ICD-10 code I21.01).\n\nOver the course of your hospitalization, a series of interventions were undertaken in accordance with the standard management of myocardial infarctions. You received appropriate medical therapy, including administration of Morphine for pain management, Oxygen supplementation to maintain oxygen saturation levels, Nitroglycerin for chest pain relief, and a single dose of Aspirin for its antiplatelet effects. Despite attempts to arrange Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) as per local hospital guidelines, communication barriers precluded timely access to catheterization services.\n\nCardiac enzymes were assessed, with Troponin T levels recorded at 30 and 29 on March 11, 2024. These elevated biomarkers confirmed myocardial injury consistent with your clinical diagnosis.\n\nThroughout your stay, your condition was closely monitored, and by the night of March 12, 2024, you reported a resolution of chest pain. In light of your improved clinical condition and upon your request for discharge, you have been deemed stable for discharge with guidance for further management.\n\nFor your ongoing care, we recommend scheduled follow-up with your primary care physician or cardiologist to monitor your cardiovascular health. It is essential to adhere to prescribed medications and to notify your healthcare provider of any recurrence of symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. Lifestyle modifications, including adherence to a heart-healthy diet, regular physical activity, and smoking cessation, are strongly advised to support your recovery and prevent future cardiac events.\n\nThank you for entrusting us with your care. Please do not hesitate to contact us or your healthcare provider should you have further questions or concerns.\n\nWishing you a smooth recovery and continued health.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. ___\n[Hospital/Clinic Name]\n[Contact Information]"
