  "assistant": "[Patient's Address]  \n[City, State, ZIP Code]  \n[Date]\n\nDear Mr. ___,\n\nI am writing to summarize the details of your recent hospitalization at ___ Hospital from March 10, 2024, to March 12, 2024, due to a cardiac event. Upon presentation, you had reported symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, which led to your admission.\n\nOn the day of admission, you were transported to the hospital via ambulance with the primary complaint of chest pain (CP) and shortness of breath (SoB). An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed significant ST elevation in leads v5-6, indicative of an acute coronary event. Consequently, you were diagnosed with an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the left main coronary artery, as per the ICD code I2101.\n\nIn response to the findings, immediate medical management was initiated, adhering to the MONAC protocol. This included administration of Morphine (2-4 mg as needed for pain relief), Oxygen Therapy (2-4 L/min should your oxygen saturation drop below 90%), Nitroglycerin (0.4 mg every five minutes for up to three doses if chest pain persisted), and a single 324 mg dose of Aspirin to be chewed.\n\nLaboratory investigations were conducted, including serial measurements of Troponin T levels, which showed elevated levels of 30 and 29, further corroborating the diagnosis of a myocardial infarction.\n\nDuring your stay, repeated efforts were made to contact the cardiac catheterization lab for a percutaneous coronary intervention, as per hospital guidelines. However, logistical challenges precluded immediate intervention. It was recorded that the cardiology team had been unreachable, and the ECG continued to depict persistent ST elevation.\n\nOn the evening of March 12, 2024, during a ward round consultation, you expressed a desire to be discharged, acknowledging that your chest pain had resolved, which indicated stabilization of your acute condition.\n\nAt the time of your discharge, it is essential to adhere to any recommended follow-up consultations with your cardiologist and maintain prescribed medications to ensure ongoing management of your cardiac health. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out should you experience any recurrence of symptoms or have concerns regarding your health.\n\nWishing you a smooth recovery and good health.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. ___  \nResident Physician  \n___ Hospital  \n[Contact Information]"
