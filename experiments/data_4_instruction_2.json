  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 65, 'gender': 'Male', 'admission_date': '2024-03-10', 'expected_discharge_date': '2024-03-12'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'diagnosis_code': 'I2101', 'description': 'ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction involving left main coronary artery'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'CP, SoB, v5-6 ST elevation'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'type': 'ECG', 'findings': 'v5-6 ST elevation, MONAC given'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'Troponin T', 'result': '30'}, {'name': 'Troponin T', 'result': '29'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Morphine', 'dose': '2-4 mg', 'frequency': 'As needed for pain'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Oxygen', 'dose': '2-4 L/min', 'frequency': 'If O2 sat < 90%'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Nitroglycerin', 'dose': '0.4 mg', 'frequency': 'Every 5 minutes for 3 doses if pain persists'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Aspirin', 'dose': '324 mg', 'frequency': 'Single dose, chewed'}], 'ward_round_notes': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'time': 'Evening', 'note': 'Patient presented w/ SoB, CP through ambulance.

  "assistant": "[Hospital Name]  \n[Hospital Address]  \n[City, State, ZIP Code]  \n[Phone Number]  \n\n[Date]  \n\nDear ___,  \n\nWe are writing this letter in regard to your recent hospitalization at [Hospital Name], which spanned from March 10, 2024, to your anticipated discharge on March 12, 2024. \n\nOn March 10, 2024, you were admitted to our facility with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated significant ST elevation in leads V5-6, which prompted immediate admission for further cardiac assessment due to the suspicion of a ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\n\nOn the following day, March 11, further cardiac evaluations were undertaken. Serial ECG monitoring confirmed persistent ST elevation, and blood tests exhibited elevated Troponin T levels, with results recorded as 30 ng/L and 29 ng/L, indicating cardiac ischemia. You were consequently diagnosed with an ST elevation myocardial infarction involving the left main coronary artery.\n\nDuring your stay, you received pharmacological treatment following local hospital protocols, including Morphine as needed for pain management, Oxygen supplementation if oxygen saturation fell below 90%, and Nitroglycerin every five minutes for three doses if chest pain persisted. A single dose of Aspirin was administered, chewed, at a dosage of 324 mg to aid in antiplatelet therapy.\n\nDespite efforts to follow guidelines, we were faced with logistical challenges as immediate contact with the catheterization lab was unattainable, and communication with the cardiology team was restricted. Despite these circumstances, medical management remained the primary focus.\n\nBy the night of March 12, during rounds, you expressed a desire to be discharged as your chest pain had resolved. Taking into consideration the improvement in your symptoms and your personal request, discharge was considered suitable.\n\nIn light of your condition, it remains crucial that you adhere to the continuous care plan outlined upon discharge. Follow-up appointments with your cardiologist are integral to ensuring your cardiac health is adequately monitored and managed. Furthermore, remaining vigilant for any recurrent symptoms or complications is imperative.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or require further medical guidance. It has been our privilege to take care of you, and we wish you the best in your recovery journey.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nDr. ___  \n[Hospital Name]  \n[Title]  \n[Contact Information]"
