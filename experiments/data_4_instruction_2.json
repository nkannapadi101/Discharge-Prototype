  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 65, 'gender': 'Male', 'admission_date': '2024-03-10', 'expected_discharge_date': '2024-03-12'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'diagnosis_code': 'I2101', 'description': 'ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction involving left main coronary artery'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'CP, SoB, v5-6 ST elevation'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'type': 'ECG', 'findings': 'v5-6 ST elevation, MONAC given'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'Troponin T', 'result': '30'}, {'name': 'Troponin T', 'result': '29'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Morphine', 'dose': '2-4 mg', 'frequency': 'As needed for pain'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Oxygen', 'dose': '2-4 L/min', 'frequency': 'If O2 sat < 90%'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Nitroglycerin', 'dose': '0.4 mg', 'frequency': 'Every 5 minutes for 3 doses if pain persists'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Aspirin', 'dose': '324 mg', 'frequency': 'Single dose, chewed'}], 'ward_round_notes': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'time': 'Evening', 'note': 'Patient presented w/ SoB, CP through ambulance.

  "assistant": "March 12, 2024\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nRe: Discharge Summary for ___ (Age: 65, Gender: Male)\n\nAdmission Date: March 10, 2024  \nExpected Discharge Date: March 12, 2024\n\nThe patient, a 65-year-old male, was admitted to our facility on March 10, 2024, following presentation with symptoms of chest pain (CP) and shortness of breath (SoB). An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) conducted on the day of admission indicated ST elevation in the v5-6 leads, consistent with an acute myocardial infarction. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the left main coronary artery (diagnosis code: I2101) is established.\n\nDuring the hospital stay, the patient received immediate medical management including the administration of Morphine at doses of 2-4 mg as needed for pain relief. Supplemental Oxygen was provided at a rate of 2-4 liters per minute if oxygen saturation fell below 90%. Nitroglycerin was administered in doses of 0.4 mg every five minutes, with a maximum of three doses to alleviate persistent chest pain. Additionally, a single dose of 324 mg Aspirin was administered, chewed, to inhibit platelet aggregation effectively.\n\nLaboratory results from March 11, 2024, revealed elevated Troponin T levels, with readings of 30 and 29, corroborating the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Despite multiple attempts to follow local hospital guidelines for a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), attempts to involve the catheterization lab and the cardiology team were unsuccessful.\n\nBy the night of March 12, 2024, the patient reported resolution of chest pain and expressed his wish to be discharged. His condition at discharge is stable, with no ongoing chest pain and vital signs within normal parameters.\n\nIt is recommended that the patient now continue with prescribed cardiac medications, attend follow-up appointments with a cardiologist to monitor his cardiac status, and immediately seek medical attention if he experiences any recurrence of symptoms such as chest pain or difficulty breathing.\n\nWe extend our best wishes for his ongoing recovery and shall remain available for any further questions or follow-up requirements.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDr. ___  \n[Name of Hospital]  \n[Contact Information]"
