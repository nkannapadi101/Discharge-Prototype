  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth.

  "assistant": "[Patient's Name]  \n[Patient's Address]  \n[City, State, ZIP Code]  \n\nMarch 12, 2024  \n\nDear [Patient's Name],\n\nI hope this letter finds you well. As you prepare to return home, I am writing to provide a summary of your recent hospital stay from March 10, 2024, to March 12, 2024.\n\nUpon your admission on March 10, 2024, you presented with symptoms of chest pain (CP) and shortness of breath (SoB). An electrocardiogram (ECG) conducted shortly thereafter revealed ST elevation in the v5-6 leads, indicating a potential myocardial event. Consequently, based on these findings and your reported symptoms, you were admitted to the hospital under the diagnosis of an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the left main coronary artery.\n\nFollowing your admission, you underwent further diagnostic evaluations, which included ECG monitoring that consistently showed persistent ST elevation. In light of these findings, the MONAC protocol was instituted, which included the administration of medications such as Morphine for pain management, Oxygen for maintaining adequate saturation, Nitroglycerin for chest pain occurring every five minutes with a limit of three doses, and a single 324 mg dose of chewed Aspirin.\n\nYour troponin T levels were measured on March 11, 2024, with results indicating values of 30 and 29 respectively, suggesting myocardial injury. Throughout your stay, efforts were made to contact the catheterization lab, but due to communication limitations, a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCA) could not be arranged during your admission.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, during the night, you expressed your desire to be discharged as your symptoms of chest pain had resolved. At the time of discharge, your condition was stable, and you reported no further occurrences of chest discomfort.\n\nYour follow-up plans have been discussed, and it is advised that you continue to monitor your symptoms closely. I recommend scheduling an appointment with your cardiologist for ongoing evaluation and to discuss any further interventions that may be required. Please ensure adherence to prescribed medications and attend all follow-up appointments as directed.\n\nIf you experience any recurrence of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or if you feel unwell, it is imperative that you seek medical attention promptly.\n\nThank you for entrusting us with your care. Please feel free to reach out should you have any questions or concerns regarding your treatment or future plans.\n\nWishing you a smooth recovery and good health.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. ___  \n[Hospital Name]  \n[Contact Information]"
