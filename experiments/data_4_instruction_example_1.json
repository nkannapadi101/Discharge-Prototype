Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nOn 10th March 2024, you were admitted to our hospital with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Your initial evaluation included an electrocardiogram (ECG) which revealed ST elevation in leads V5 and V6, prompting admission for suspected acute coronary syndrome.\n\nDuring your stay, further diagnostic evaluation on 11th March confirmed a diagnosis of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the left main coronary artery. Laboratory tests revealed elevated levels of Troponin T, indicative of myocardial injury, with results of 30 and 29 ng/L.\n\nIn accordance with hospital protocols, medical management included administration of Morphine for pain relief (2-4 mg as needed), Oxygen therapy (2-4 L/min to maintain saturation above 90%), Nitroglycerin (0.4 mg every 5 minutes for a maximum of three doses to alleviate persistent chest pain), and a single dose of Aspirin (324 mg, chewed) to inhibit platelet aggregation.\n\nUnfortunately, due to an inability to contact the catheterization laboratory and a non-responsive cardiology team, primary coronary intervention (PCI) could not be executed.\n\nBy night-time on 12th March, you reported a resolution of chest pain and requested discharge from the hospital. At discharge, your condition appeared stable, with no further episodes of chest pain reported.\n\nIt is imperative that you adhere to follow-up care and maintain close monitoring of your cardiovascular status. Please schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss ongoing management and consider referral to a cardiology specialist. It is crucial to adhere to lifestyle modifications and prescribed medications to prevent recurrence.\n\nWe recommend addressing any queries or concerns with your healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n___  \nResident Physician"
