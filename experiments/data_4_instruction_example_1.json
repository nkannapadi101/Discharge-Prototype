  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 65, 'gender': 'Male', 'admission_date': '2024-03-10', 'expected_discharge_date': '2024-03-12'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'diagnosis_code': 'I2101', 'description': 'ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction involving left main coronary artery'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'CP, SoB, v5-6 ST elevation'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'type': 'ECG', 'findings': 'v5-6 ST elevation, MONAC given'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'Troponin T', 'result': '30'}, {'name': 'Troponin T', 'result': '29'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Morphine', 'dose': '2-4 mg', 'frequency': 'As needed for pain'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Oxygen', 'dose': '2-4 L/min', 'frequency': 'If O2 sat < 90%'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Nitroglycerin', 'dose': '0.4 mg', 'frequency': 'Every 5 minutes for 3 doses if pain persists'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Aspirin', 'dose': '324 mg', 'frequency': 'Single dose, chewed'}], 'ward_round_notes': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'time': 'Evening', 'note': 'Patient presented w/ SoB, CP through ambulance.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 10, 2024, presenting with chest pain (CP) and shortness of breath (SoB). An electrocardiogram (ECG) carried out shortly after your arrival indicated ST elevation in leads V5-6, suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. Based on your clinical presentation and the ECG findings, it was determined that you were experiencing a ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the left main coronary artery.\n\nDuring your hospital stay, you were administered the MONAC (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin, and Clopidogrel) protocol, as part of standard medical therapy for STEMI. The medications included Morphine (2-4 mg, as needed for pain), Oxygen (2-4 L/min if oxygen saturation was less than 90%), Nitroglycerin (0.4 mg every 5 minutes for up to 3 doses if pain persisted), and a single dose of Aspirin (324 mg, chewed). Despite efforts, the local hospital guidelines suggested percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but there were logistical challenges in contacting the catheterization lab and the cardiology team initially did not respond to pages. \n\nLaboratory tests to assess cardiac enzymes showed elevated levels of Troponin T (30 and 29 respectively), confirming myocardial injury.\n\nThroughout your stay, you were closely monitored, and the persistent ST elevation noted on ECG necessitated careful observation and continued medical management. On March 12, 2024, you expressed the desire to be discharged, as your chest pain had resolved, suggesting a stabilization of your condition.\n\nAt discharge, your immediate condition appears stable, with resolved chest pain and no acute distress. It is advisable to follow up regularly with your primary care physician and cardiologist to monitor your cardiac health and continue necessary treatment. It is crucial to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen and report any recurrence of chest pain or new symptoms promptly. Further assessment and possibly a referral for PCI could be considered during your ongoing outpatient care.\n\nPlease schedule an appointment with your cardiology outpatient clinic to ensure comprehensive follow-up and management of your cardiac condition.\n\nSincerely,\n\n___"
