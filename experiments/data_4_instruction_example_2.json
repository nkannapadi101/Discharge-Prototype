  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 65, 'gender': 'Male', 'admission_date': '2024-03-10', 'expected_discharge_date': '2024-03-12'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'diagnosis_code': 'I2101', 'description': 'ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction involving left main coronary artery'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'CP, SoB, v5-6 ST elevation'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'type': 'ECG', 'findings': 'v5-6 ST elevation, MONAC given'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'Troponin T', 'result': '30'}, {'name': 'Troponin T', 'result': '29'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Morphine', 'dose': '2-4 mg', 'frequency': 'As needed for pain'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Oxygen', 'dose': '2-4 L/min', 'frequency': 'If O2 sat < 90%'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Nitroglycerin', 'dose': '0.4 mg', 'frequency': 'Every 5 minutes for 3 doses if pain persists'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Aspirin', 'dose': '324 mg', 'frequency': 'Single dose, chewed'}], 'ward_round_notes': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'time': 'Evening', 'note': 'Patient presented w/ SoB, CP through ambulance.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 10, 2024, due to complaints of chest pain (CP) and shortness of breath (SoB), with electrocardiogram (ECG) findings indicating ST elevation in leads V5-6, suggestive of an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the left main coronary artery. Upon presentation and throughout your stay, troponin T levels were elevated, with results of 30 and 29, further confirming myocardial injury.\n\nDuring the initial assessment on the evening of your admission, hospital guidelines indicated the need for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCA); however, attempts to contact the catheterization lab were unsuccessful, and the cardiology team was unavailable to respond at the time. As a result, medical management was initiated. You were administered a standard MONAC regimen which included Morphine for pain management, offered at doses of 2-4 mg as needed. Oxygen was administered at 2-4 L/min if oxygen saturation dropped below 90%. Nitroglycerin was provided at 0.4 mg every 5 minutes for up to three doses if chest pain persisted. A single chewable dose of Aspirin, 324 mg, was also given early in your stay to inhibit platelet aggregation.\n\nDespite initial interventions, the ECG continued to show persistent ST elevation the following night. However, by the night of March 12, 2024, your condition had stabilized significantly, and you expressed that your chest pain had resolved and subsequently requested discharge.\n\nYou are now being discharged in a stable condition with resolved chest pain. It is essential to continue close follow-up with your primary care physician or a cardiologist soon after discharge to monitor your recovery and manage any cardiovascular risks. \n\nPlease adhere to the medication regimen provided and report any recurrence of chest pain or return of symptoms to your healthcare provider immediately.\n\nWe have informed your GP of your hospital stay and will ensure you receive an appointment for further evaluation and continued care.\n\nWe wish you a steady recovery and good health.\n\nSincerely,\n\n___"
