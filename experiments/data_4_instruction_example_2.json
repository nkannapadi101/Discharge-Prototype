  "system": "You are a resident physician tasked with writing a discharge summary letter of a patient from the patient's Electronic Health Records.",
  "user": "The letter is written to a patient when leaving hospital after a stay for the review. It should be prose and not contain bullet points.\nInclude summary of stay including, if applicable, key issues, interventions, procedures, and treatments.\nInclude summary of condition at discharge.\nInclude recommendations for follow-up plans and ongoing treatment.\nWrite the text in the style of a discharge letter using medical terminology. Proceed chronologically, write factually, objectively and concretely, formally, professionally, politely, respectfully. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, verbose and cumbersome formulations, and redundancy. Do not invent or presume anything. Generally, formulate in the imperfect tense, reported speech from individuals (e.g., from patients) in subjunctive I, and medical assessments and diagnoses in the present tense.\nMinimize hallucinations. Do not generate recommendations on your own or add anything. Write nothing about topics for which there is no information basis from the EHR.\nDon't include all private information, such as ID and date of birth. Use ___ to represent names of patients and medical professionals.\n\nThis is an example of discharge summary letter:\nDear ___,\n\nYou came into hospital because you were getting more short of breath and your ankles were swollen.\n\nA heart scan, called an echocardiogram, showed that your heart was not pumping as well as it should.\n\nWe started you on water tablets called Furosemide. They will stop fluid collecting in your legs and lungs.\n\nPlease take 2 Furosemide tablets (2 x 40 mg = 80 mg) each morning and weigh yourself each morning.\n\nIf your weight drops by more than 2 kg over the week, reduce the dose to 1 tablet per day.\n\nWe have asked your GP practice to see you in about 2 weeks' time. They will take a blood test to check your kidney function.\n\nWe will see you in 6 weeks' time in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic.\n\nYou will receive an appointment letter in the post.\n\nSincerely,\n____\n\nNow, write a discharge summary letter only using the patient's EHR data provided in the following context:\n{'patient_demographics': {'age': 65, 'gender': 'Male', 'admission_date': '2024-03-10', 'expected_discharge_date': '2024-03-12'}, 'diagnoses': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'diagnosis_code': 'I2101', 'description': 'ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction involving left main coronary artery'}], 'encounters': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'type': 'Admission', 'reason': 'CP, SoB, v5-6 ST elevation'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'type': 'ECG', 'findings': 'v5-6 ST elevation, MONAC given'}], 'labs': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'tests': [{'name': 'Troponin T', 'result': '30'}, {'name': 'Troponin T', 'result': '29'}]}], 'med_orders': [{'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Morphine', 'dose': '2-4 mg', 'frequency': 'As needed for pain'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Oxygen', 'dose': '2-4 L/min', 'frequency': 'If O2 sat < 90%'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Nitroglycerin', 'dose': '0.4 mg', 'frequency': 'Every 5 minutes for 3 doses if pain persists'}, {'date': '2024-03-11', 'medication': 'Aspirin', 'dose': '324 mg', 'frequency': 'Single dose, chewed'}], 'ward_round_notes': [{'date': '2024-03-10', 'time': 'Evening', 'note': 'Patient presented w/ SoB, CP through ambulance.

  "assistant": "Dear ___,\n\nYou were admitted to the hospital on March 10, 2024, after presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. An electrocardiogram (ECG) conducted upon arrival revealed ST elevation in leads v5-6, indicative of an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the left main coronary artery. These findings necessitated immediate medical intervention according to local hospital guidelines.\n\nUpon admission, you received the MONAC protocol, which included morphine, oxygen, nitroglycerin, aspirin, and other necessary treatments to stabilize your condition. These interventions aimed to alleviate pain and improve cardiac oxygenation. Despite attempts to proceed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as per protocol, difficulties arose in contacting the catheterization lab, and the cardiology team was unable to be reached at the time. Consequently, management followed a conservative approach while ensuring ongoing monitoring of your condition.\n\nLaboratory tests conducted on March 11th showed elevated levels of Troponin T, with results of 30 and 29, confirming myocardial injury. Despite persistent ST elevation monitored through subsequent ECGs, your condition showed clinical improvement with the resolution of chest pain, as noted in the ward rounds.\n\nOn the night of March 12th, you expressed a wish to be discharged due to the complete resolution of chest pain. At the time of discharge, you appeared stable with no active ischemic discomfort. As part of your ongoing care, it is important to adhere to prescribed medications and monitor for any recurrence of symptoms. Follow-up appointments are essential to facilitate continuous evaluation and adjustment of your treatment plan.\n\nPlease ensure to maintain communication with your primary care physician for further management of your cardiac health and attend scheduled cardiology outpatient reviews. Should any concerns or symptoms arise prior to your follow-up visit, do not hesitate to seek immediate medical attention.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation during your stay and wish you a smooth recovery.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. ___\n\n[Hospital Name]\n[Contact Information]"
